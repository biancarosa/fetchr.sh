## Development Principles

As we develop new features, we maintain focus on:

- **Simplicity**: Keep the core simple and easy to understand
- **Performance**: Optimize for low latency and high throughput
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive testing and error handling
- **Documentation**: Clear, up-to-date documentation
- **Community**: Open development, responsive to feedback
- **Security**: Security-first approach in all features
- **Compatibility**: Maintain backwards compatibility when possible

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Features may be reprioritized based on:
- Community requests and feedback
- Security requirements
- Performance needs
- Real-world usage patterns

See CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines on proposing and implementing features.
